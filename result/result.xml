VMware host memory overwrite vulnerability (data pointers)
&lt;br&gt;
Due to a flaw in the handler function for RPC commands, it is
possible to manipulate data pointers within the VMX process.
This vulnerability may allow a guest user to crash the VMX
process or potentially execute code on the host.
&lt;br&gt;
Workaround
&lt;br&gt;
- Configure virtual machines to use less than 4 GB of memory.
Virtual machines that have less than 4GB of memory are not 
affected.
&lt;br&gt;
OR
&lt;br&gt;
- Disable VIX messages from each guest VM by editing the
configuration file (.vmx) for the virtual machine as described
in VMware Knowledge Base article 1714. Add the following line :
isolation.tools.vixMessage.disable = 'TRUE'.
Note: This workaround is not valid for Workstation 7.x and
Fusion 3.x
&lt;br&gt;
Mitigation
&lt;br&gt;
- Do not allow untrusted users access to your virtual machines.
Root or Administrator level permissions are not required to
exploit this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2012-1516 to this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
VMware would like to thank Derek Soeder of Ridgeway Internet
Security, L.L.C. for reporting this issue to us.
&lt;br&gt;
b. VMware host memory overwrite vulnerability (function pointers)
&lt;br&gt;
Due to a flaw in the handler function for RPC commands, it is
possible to manipulate function pointers within the VMX process.
This vulnerability may allow a guest user to crash the VMX
process or potentially execute code on the host.
&lt;br&gt;
Workaround
&lt;br&gt;
- None identified
&lt;br&gt;
Mitigation
&lt;br&gt;
- Do not allow untrusted users access to your virtual machines.
Root or Administrator level permissions are not required to
exploit this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2012-1517 to this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
VMware would like to thank Derek Soeder of Ridgeway Internet
Security, L.L.C. for reporting this issue to us.
&lt;br&gt;
c. ESX NFS traffic parsing vulnerability
&lt;br&gt;
Due to a flaw in the handling of NFS traffic, it is possible to
overwrite memory. This vulnerability may allow a user with
access to the network to execute code on the ESXi/ESX host
without authentication. The issue is not present in cases where
there is no NFS traffic.
&lt;br&gt;
Workaround
- None identified
&lt;br&gt;
Mitigation
- Connect only to trusted NFS servers
- Segregate the NFS network
- Harden your NFS server
&lt;br&gt;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2012-2448 to this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
d. VMware floppy device out-of-bounds memory write
&lt;br&gt;
Due to a flaw in the virtual floppy configuration it is possible
to perform an out-of-bounds memory write. This vulnerability may
allow a guest user to crash the VMX process or potentially
execute code on the host.
&lt;br&gt;
Workaround
&lt;br&gt;
- Remove the virtual floppy drive from the list of virtual IO
devices. The VMware hardening guides recommend removing unused
virtual IO devices in general.
&lt;br&gt;
Mitigation
&lt;br&gt;
- Do not allow untrusted root users in your virtual
machines. Root or Administrator level permissions are required
to exploit this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2012-2449 to this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
e. VMware SCSI device unchecked memory write
&lt;br&gt;
Due to a flaw in the SCSI device registration it is possible to
perform an unchecked write into memory. This vulnerability may
allow a guest user to crash the VMX process or potentially
execute code on the host.
&lt;br&gt;
Workaround
&lt;br&gt;
- Remove the virtual SCSI controller from the list of virtual IO
devices. The VMware hardening guides recommend removing unused
virtual IO devices in general.
&lt;br&gt;
Mitigation
&lt;br&gt;
- Do not allow untrusted root users access to your virtual
machines.  Root or Administrator level permissions are
required to exploit this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2012-2450 to this issue.

&lt;br&gt;
Input data is not properly validated when loading Checkpoint files.
This may allow an attacker with the ability to load a specially
crafted Checkpoint file to execute arbitrary code on the host.
&lt;br&gt;
Workaround
- None identified
&lt;br&gt;
Mitigation
- Do not import virtual machines from untrusted sources.
&lt;br&gt;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2012-3288 to this issue.
&lt;br&gt;
b. VMware Virtual Machine Remote Device Denial of Service
&lt;br&gt;
A device (e.g. CD-ROM, keyboard) that is available to a virtual
machine while physically connected to a system that does not run the
virtual machine is referred to as a remote device.
&lt;br&gt;
Traffic coming from remote virtual devices is incorrectly handled.
This may allow an attacker who is capable of manipulating the
traffic from a remote virtual device to crash the virtual machine.
&lt;br&gt;
Workaround
- None identified
&lt;br&gt;
Mitigation
- Users need administrative privileges on the virtual machine
in order to attach remote devices.
- Do not attach untrusted remote devices to a virtual machine.
&lt;br&gt;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2012-3289 to this issue.
